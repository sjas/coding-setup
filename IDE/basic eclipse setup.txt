=========================
ECLIPE SETUP FROM SCRATCH (working for Eclipse 3.6 and 3.7)
=========================

1. Download needed Eclipse Package 

2. Put 'workspace' into the same Folder as is the 'eclipse'-root is, so that they are on the same level in the file system

3. Put the 'Outline'-view in started Eclipse left, below the 'Package Explorer'-view

4. Install Plugins: (Alt + H + S)
   VRAPPER - http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/update-site/stable
   	Set 'Ctrl + Alt + Shift + V' as a short for toggling it:
   		PREFERENCES: (Alt + W + P)
		General -> Keys:
			search for 'vrapper'
			set 'Binding' to 'Ctrl+Alt+Shift+V'
			set 'When' to 'In Windows'
   COLOR THEME - http://eclipse-color-theme.github.com/update
   	Use Theme:

		(Import the NewZenburn_to_import.xml from within the Preferences.)

5. Workspace settings:
   PREFERENCES:

   	General -> Workspace:
		'Refresh automatically'
		'Save automatically before build'
   workspace encoding utf8 + unix line endings to avoid character set problems in group work:
	General -> Workspace: 'Text File Encoding' + 'New Text File Line Delimiter'

6. Set Eclipse GUI:
   PREFERENCES:
   show heap:
	General:
		'Show heap status'
   only perspective buttons without text:
  	General -> Appearance
		'Override presentation settings'
		Not 'Show text on the perspective bar'
   font:
   	General -> Appearance -> Colors and Fonts
		Basic >> Text Font, 'Edit'

7. Define Save Actions:
   PREFERENCES:
   Java -> Editor -> Save Actions: 
   	Format source code
	Organize imports
	Additional actions

8. Fix Code Templates:
   Insert two blank lines starting wit ' * ', so commenting code is easier.
   Set your real name in the comments, since the global system var 'user' ususally is rarely desired:
	   PREFERENCES:
	   Java -> Code Style -> Code Templates:
		choose 'Types' (it's the template for a new class), "Edit"
		exchange '${user}' with own name or desired description
		Don't forget adding the blank lines.

9. Link files with Version Control
   Either checkout/clone the repository into the workspace.
   Or put the complete Workspace under version control.
   Set a Shortcut for commiting at least, no matter what version control system is in use.
   	PREFERENCES:
	General -> Keys 
		set then key to commit for Git/SVN/whatever you use

		Don't forget to set "When" to 'In Windows', else the Binding won't work.

		PLUS: (Alt + W + Z)
		Window >> Customize Perspective:
			Tab: 'Command Groups Availability'
			'Available command groups:'
				- SVN
				- Team
				- Git (if needed)
		Choose this for the Perspective you need it in!!!
